Monefy is a budget app where a user can add, edit, delete it's expenses and income.User can keep a track of all the
expenses and income of the year. User can save the expenses and income on daily, weekly and yearly basis. User can also
view reports of it's expenses and incomes by selecting the particular day, week, month, year.User is allowed to add and
delete bank accounts.

Approach: I have created the test plan and high level test scenarios covering the application in an excel sheet.
I have created the automated test scripts covering the high level scenarios for Anroid Device using Ranorex Tool and language used as C#.
Please install Ranorex Tool Trial Version in the system to execute and view the implementation.You need to install Ranorex Service App in your anroid mobile and connect
the device to the machine from Ranorex Endpoint.And the monefy app apk file should be deployed in the device through Ranorex Instrumentation Wizard.
After the app is deployed it will be visible in Ranorex Service App. Launch the monefy app in the anroid device from inside the Ranorex Service App.
MonefyApp should be open in the anroid device and then can execute from Ranorex tool.

Note: I have focused on Task 1 (Creating test plan and test scenarios) and Task 2 (Anroid Automation).
